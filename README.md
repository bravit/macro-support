# Rust macro support in the IntelliJ Rust plugin

This repository accompanies the blog post about macro support on the [IntelliJ Rust plugin blog](https://blog.jetbrains.com/rust/).
The `macro_examples` crate provides several examples of procedural macro implementations. 
The `demo` crate demonstrates how they can be used and how an IDE assists with that.
